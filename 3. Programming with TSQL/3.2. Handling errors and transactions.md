## Handling errors and transactions

  With T-SQL like any programming language we can handle erros, the basic sintax is:

  ```sql
  BEGIN TRY
    /* some code here */
  END TRY
  BEGIN CATCH
    /* error handling */
  END CATCH
  ```
  
  As you can see the error handling in SQL Server are simple, we have a try and catch block, if some code return a erro at try block, the handling in the catch block is executed.
