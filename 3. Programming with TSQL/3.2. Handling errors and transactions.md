## 3.2. Handling errors and transactions

  With T-SQL like any programming language we can handle erros making use of ```TRY``` and ```CATCH``` blocks, the basic structure is:

  ```sql
  BEGIN TRY
    /* some code here */
  END TRY
  BEGIN CATCH
    /* error handling */
  END CATCH
  ```

  As you can see the error handling in SQL Server are simple, we have a try and catch block, in the try block we can write some code, if some error occur in any code inside try block, the catch block are executed e in this block must have a error handle. Before explain more details about error handling let's see some thing about the errors in the SQL Server. 

### Errors in the SQL Server
  
  The erros in SQL Server have some properties like:
  
  - number ```number```
  - message ```text```
  - state ```number```
  - severity ```number```
  - procedure ```text```
  - line ```number```
  
  With this itens we can get some informations about the error:
  - ```number``` can identify a error;
  - ```message``` describe the error;
  - ```state``` are normally used to specify where the error occur
  - ```severity``` is possible understand the criticality about a error. The ```severity level``` between 0 and 10 aren considered a message or information, severitys between 20 and 25 **terminate the connection**, erros between ranges 0-10 and 20-25 are not handle, severitys between 11 and 17 are handle;
  - ```procedure``` returns the procedure name where the error are origned, a erorr by a ad-hoc or dinamic sql query the procedure name don't returns; 
  - ```line``` number means the error line in your code;

  Let's see any errors, write and execute this code on [SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017):

  ```sql
    RAISERROR('any error', 1, 1);
  ```

  This returns a message:

  ```
  any error
  Msg 50000, Level 1, State 1
  ```

  See the error number 50000, severity level 1, state 1. Note the severity level are 1, therefore it's only a information message, don't abort the query statement, let's make a test:

  ```sql
    RAISERROR('Some info', 1, 1);

    PRINT('Wow the query was not aborted')
  ```

  This result:

  ```
  Some info
  Msg 50000, Level 1, State 1
  Wow the query was not aborted
  ```

  The print command are executed after the error, but if we have a severity level up to 10? Let's make use of TRY-CATCH blocks:

  ```sql
  BEGIN TRY
    DECLARE @tb TABLE (
      id integer unique
    )
    
    INSERT INTO @tb
    VALUES(1),(1)
    
    PRINT('The select was not executed')
    SELECT *
    FROM @tb;
  END TRY
  BEGIN CATCH
    THROW; --//re raising a error
  END CATCH
  ```

  ```
  (0 rows affected)
  Msg 2627, Level 14, State 1, Line 7
  Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint 'UQ__#BF78AB8__3213E83ECAD62035'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.@tb'. The duplicate key value is (1).
  ```

  The statement are termined and the code flow are stopped, going to CATCH block, just for demostration, I reraise the error in the catch block, the THROW command without parameters do this, normaly in the catch block the error are handled. Let's see a error with severity level up to 20:

  ```sql
    RAISERROR('Terminate the connection', 20, 1) WITH LOG;
  ```
  ```
  Msg 2745, Level 16, State 2, Line 1
  Process ID 52 has raised user error 50000, severity 20. SQL Server is terminating this process.
  Msg 50000, Level 20, State 1, Line 1
  Terminate the connection
  Msg 596, Level 21, State 1, Line 0
  Cannot continue the execution because the session is in the kill state.
  Msg 0, Level 20, State 0, Line 0
  A severe error occurred on the current command.  The results, if any, should be discarded.
  ```

  Note the severity level 20, and the message "Terminate the connection", the connection are terminated, for serious errors the connection have to be terminated.

  ### Raising a error using RAISERROR and THROW commands
